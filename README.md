## Plot

Paddington receives a letter from the home for retired bears in Peru, informing him that Aunt Lucy deeply misses him and is acting strangely. Paddington and the Browns decide to go to Peru to visit her. Upon arriving in Peru, the Browns learn from the Reverend Mother that Aunt Lucy has gone missing in the jungle, leaving behind only her glasses and her bracelet. Paddington finds a map in Aunt Lucy's cabin indicating they should start their search at a place called Rumi Rock; Mrs. Bird and the Reverend Mother stay behind and the Reverend Mother gives Mrs. Brown a pendant for good luck.

The Browns look to hire a boat to travel down the river, meeting treasure hunters Hunter Cabot and his daughter Gina. Hunter notices Paddington's bracelet and informs the family of the lost city of El Dorado, a mythical place that is said to contain the gold offered by ancient Peruvians to the jungle spirits; travelers in search of El Dorado typically begin their searches at Rumi Rock, but do not return alive. Hunter is driven by the ghosts of his ancestors to find gold at any cost and wishes to hijack the trip to find El Dorado himself; he and Gina argue about continuing the journey, with Gina wanting him to turn back. In response, Hunter throws Gina off, but then falls overboard himself, causing the boat to shipwreck.

Paddington gets separated from the family and stumbles upon Rumi Rock, where Hunter is waiting for him. Following roars that Paddington believes are calls and responses from himself and Lucy, Hunter and Paddington duly set off in search of El Dorado and Aunt Lucy. Gina locates the Browns and explains her father's motivations and family history; they set out to find Paddington and save him from Hunter. Mrs. Bird grows suspicious of the Reverend Mother and discovers a secret room where she reveals that the pendant she gave to Mrs. Brown is actually a tracker. Now knowing their location, Mrs. Bird and the Reverend Mother fly in with a plane to rescue the Browns.

After reaching the summit of an Incan fort, which contains a coin slot for an emblem on Paddington's bracelet, Hunter attacks and chases Paddington, but the Browns arrive just in time to save him. The Reverend Mother reveals herself as Clarissa Cabot, Hunter's long lost cousin who was thought to be deceased, also wishing to find El Dorado. Clarissa reveals that she staged Aunt Lucy's disappearance to entice Paddington to come to Peru. She then holds the Browns and Gina at gunpoint, but Hunter intervenes by incapacitating Clarissa. The Browns use Paddington's bracelet to enter El Dorado. They find Aunt Lucy, who explains that El Dorado is an orangery where Paddington was born and that her bracelet was originally Paddington's when she found him, used by the bears of El Dorado. Paddington bonds with the other bears making marmalade, but chooses to return to London with the Browns.

In the aftermath, Hunter and Gina have reconciled, Clarissa is sent to the North Pole to become a real nun and work at the home for retired polar bears, and several El Dorado bears visit Paddington in London and are named after other London rail stations. Paddington and the bears visit Phoenix Buchanan, who believes that he will soon be released from prison and plans a production of "Goldilocks and the Three Bears" starring the El Dorado bears.
